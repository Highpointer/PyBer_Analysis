# Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this study was to analyze rideshare data in 120 cities by city type. The city types were divided into urban (66 cities), suburban (36), and rural (18) cities.

# Results

Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

In the 120 cities, there were a total of 2,375 rides and 2,973 drivers. The table below lists lists the total rides and total drivers by city type, along with total fares collected, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver.

It is apparent that with more drivers than total rides, many drivers did not take a single ride, particularly in the urban cities, where the driver count (2,405) exceeded the number of rides (1,625) by 48%.

While there were considerably fewer drivers and rides in the rural citeis, this is not a surprising result. Rural cities have smaller populations, yet farther distances to travel, so the average fare per ride would be greater. Surburban cities have more people than rural cities, yet a lower population density than urban cities, so average fares per ride and average fare per driver will fall in between the rural and urban cities.

In the more densely-populated urban cities, there are more people and distances to travel would be less, resulting in lower average fares. With more potential rides available, this would attract more drivers. However, due to the intense competition, many drivers would not be able to find rides and many drivers likely quit because they are earning little or no money.

# Summary 

Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
